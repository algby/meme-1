2010-11-15: Basic functionality

Just about usable. No known severe bugs, but many features unimplemented - not all menu options work.

Currently working:

- Basic map display
- Load/save
- Import Freemind .mm files
- Basic editing
- Node colours

To fix next:

- Some undo steps should be merged
- Display/editing of nodes containing newlines
- File overwrite prompt
- Selection should stay on-screen
- Tab title
- Toolbar colour button
- Create/delete nodes using toolbar

To implement soon:

- Home key
- Copy/paste
- Expand/collapse nodes
- Update display as you type
- Rendering options
- Code cleanups
- Multiple tabs
- Reordering nodes
- Export to text and static HTML

Future work:

- More rendering options
- Some sort of style-sheets
- Nodes to the left of the root
- I18n
- Zooming
- More principled box model
- Multiple text sizes
- Sigils
- Export to PDF, PNG, dynamic HTML
- Printing
- Distro packaging
- Title, author, etc.

To consider:

- Cross-links
- URLs
- Collaboration
- Windows support
- Switch to Clutter for display
- Export to Flash, HTML5
- Complex layouts
